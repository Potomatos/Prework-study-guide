        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language</li>
          <li> var: to declare a variable</li>
          <li> assignment operator (=): to assign specific data to be stored into the variable</li>
          <li> topics variable: contains a string that includes all the topics </li>
          <li> console.log method: used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li> the script.js file is linked within the <body> element</li>
          <li> Control flow is the order which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li> Control flow can be interrupted by utilizing conditional statements to control the order in which code is executed or if the code is even executred at all</li>
          <li> an if statement is a way to introduce decision making into our code</li>
          <li> a code using an if statement will only execute if the statement meets a certain condition or is true</li>
          <li> If you want to use more than one condition within an if statement, then you can use the else if statement within the if statement to provide more conditions</li>
          <li> The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li> An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li> A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li> The for loop contains the following 3 important statements: the 1st determines the starting point for the loop, the 2nd determiens the condition, and the 3rd is what allows the array to iterate over each item </li>
          <li> Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
          <li> A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li> To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses</li>
          <li> </li>
